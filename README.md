# Servo_CAN_controller
Board allowing to turn DC motors into servomechanisms controlled by CAN bus using ESP32-C3 chip and AS5600 magnetic encoder


This is the first version of ESP32-C3 microcontroller board with CAN transciever, DC motor driver (DRV8838) and magnetic encoder (AS5600). I will use it to control custom linear actuator.
